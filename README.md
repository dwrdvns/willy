## About Me

Hi, I’m Willy Evans — a digital strategist, nonprofit leader, and passionate advocate for creative communities.

For over six years, I led the SEO department at Digital Division, where I oversaw strategy for 50+ clients across industries. I’ve built reporting systems, optimized technical SEO, managed content teams, and driven long-term traffic growth through thoughtful, scalable solutions. I’m highly experienced with tools like Google Analytics, Looker Studio, SEMrush, and Tag Manager.

Outside of SEO, I serve as the president of Film Society KC and co-founded the KC Underground Film Festival. Both are grassroots organizations focused on expanding access to independent and inclusive media. These roles have sharpened my skills in leadership, community-building, and mission-driven storytelling.

Whether I’m working in digital marketing or community arts, my goal is the same: build things that matter and bring people together.
